python package for recommender system: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pysuggest/1.0 


Steps:
feature selection (bar charts to rule out irrelevant features)
user rating normalization
method 1: linear regression (http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/cse255/projects/Yashodhan_Karandikar.pdf Page 4)
vector (user-movie pair): features: age, gender, occupation, movie genre, avg user ratings, avg movie rating

method 2: collaborative filter
only movie features are used
user-movie matrix
